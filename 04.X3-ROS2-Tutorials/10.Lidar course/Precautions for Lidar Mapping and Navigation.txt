Before performing mapping navigation operations, be sure to power off the car and ensure it is placed stably on the ground.
Then, turn on the car and keep it stationary for 5 seconds to allow the gyroscope to complete the initialization process.
If this step is not performed, the gyroscope may experience abnormal conditions, specifically as follows:
During mapping navigation, the car body does not move, but the three-dimensional model in rviz may rotate in place or deviate in a certain direction.
